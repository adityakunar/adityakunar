- 👋 Hi, I’m @adityakunar. A M.Sc Data Scientist from TU Delft
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards bettering synthetic tabular data generation methods via GANs, read more here->[Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/ctab-gan-effective-table-data-synthesizing-39d086a1b7b0)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on investigating and evaluating privacy and memorization risks associated with training differential private GANs. Read more about my work on differential privacy here->[Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/dtgan-differential-private-training-for-tabular-gans-ba3754721b33)
- 👀 I’m passionate about A.I, machine learning and deep learning. I've worked on the following projects: </br>
      - [Computer Vision Seminar](https://github.com/adityakunar/pytorch-ssd): To achieve a fast and effective image classifier, studied the integration of the MobileNet architecture into the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework in pytorch, check out our work here -> [Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/object-detection-with-ssd-and-mobilenet-aeedc5917ad0) </br>
      - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/adityakunar/DeepLearning): For effectively preventing overfitting in deep neural networks, studied dropout as a regularizer for deep neural networks using pytorch, read more about our work-> [Blog](https://medium.com/tu-delft-eemcs-student-projects/a-reproduction-attempt-of-dropout-a-simple-way-to-prevent-neural-networks-from-overfitting-43f5c97bc314) </br>
      - [Supercomputing for Big Data](https://github.com/adityakunar/SBD-tudelft): Analysed how to optimally extract insights from the GDELT dataset using Apache Spark and AWS, read more here->[Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/big-data-processing-using-apache-spark-1beed579aadd)  
      - [Cyber Data Analytics](https://github.com/adityakunar/Cyber-Data-Analytics): Executed effective class imbalance learning and anomoly detection for static and time-series data using python </br>
      - [Multivariate Data Analysis](https://github.com/adityakunar/Multivariate-Data-Analysis):  Worked on MAP estimation for classifying healthy and diseases samples in ECG data, as well as assignments related to Bayesian regression, generalised linear models, Gibbs sampling and finally Gaussian process classification </br>
      - [Data Visualization in Tableau](https://github.com/adityakunar/InfoVis-Final-Project): Created visually appealing, user‑friendly dashboards to let end‑users explore open data about crime and policing in the UK easily and effectively </br> 
      - [Seminar Research Methodology for Data Science](https://github.com/adityakunar/semimar-data-sci): Worked on linear/logistic regression models and scientifically tested hypotheses in R; examined optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for high dimensional datasets in MATLAB</br>
      - [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/adityakunar/stance-detection): Built a fake news detector using python by implementing the techniques of the paper, ["Emergent: a novel data-set for stance classification"](https://aclanthology.org/N16-1138.pdf) </br>
