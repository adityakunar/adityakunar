- 👋 Hi, I’m @adityakunar. A M.Sc Data Scientist from TU Delft
- 👀 I’m passionate about A.I, machine learning and deep learning. I've worked on the following projects: </br>
      - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/adityakunar/DeepLearning)- A Reproduction of Dropout in Deep Learning using Pytorch. Read more about our work-> [Blog](https://medium.com/tu-delft-eemcs-student-projects/a-reproduction-attempt-of-dropout-a-simple-way-to-prevent-neural-networks-from-overfitting-43f5c97bc314) </br>
      - [Object Detection with SSD and MobileNet](https://github.com/adityakunar/pytorch-ssd)- Integrated the MobileNet architecture into the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework to achieve a fast, efficient deep learning-based method for object detection. Read more about our work here -> [Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/object-detection-with-ssd-and-mobilenet-aeedc5917ad0) </br>
      - [Supercomputing for Big Data](https://github.com/adityakunar/SBD-tudelft)- Analysed how to optimally extract insights from the GDELT dataset using Apache Spark and AWS, read more here->[Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/big-data-processing-using-apache-spark-1beed579aadd)      
      - [Cyber Data Analytics](https://github.com/adityakunar/cda-2020)- Class Imbalance Learning and Anomoly detection for Static and Time-series data using python. </br>
      - [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/adityakunar/stance-detection)- Fake news detector built using python by implementing the paper ["Emergent: a novel data-set for stance classification"](https://aclanthology.org/N16-1138.pdf). </br>
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards bettering synthetic tabular data generation methods via GANs, read more here->[Blog](https://adityakunar.medium.com/ctab-gan-effective-table-data-synthesizing-39d086a1b7b0)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on investigating and evaluating privacy and memorization risks associated with training differential private GANs
